# DHT11 Temperature/Humidity Sensor 
Take readings from the DHT11 Temperature/Humidity sensor and see them from the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.
## Components
The materials are here as follows:

Arduino Uno (Any Ardino modules will work, I have a ESP8266)

    KY-015 Arduino DHT11 Temperature/Humidity

    Jumper Wires

    Breadboard

    Cable (USB 2.0)
     
## Procedure
Step 1: Place the sensor
The pins on the sensor are S, for signal, 
the one in the middle is voltage, and the minus sign is ground. 
The signal pin goes to header A0 on the Arduino.
The middle pin goes to 5V/3V, and the minus sign goes to GND. 
Step 2: Now download our code attached to the post. In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch >> Include Library >> Add ZIP file.
